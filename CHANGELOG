Version scheme
================
	MAJOR.MINOR[.BUGFIX | -rcN]
	for example, (in order from earliest to latest)
		0.1-rc1: 0.1 initial release candidate
		0.1: release 0.1 initial release
		0.1.1: release 0.1, 1st bugfix release
		0.1.10: release 0.1, 10th bugfix release
	* Once a release has gone through about 8 cycles of bugfixes, and/or the number and severity of bugs has declined to a very low point, it is considered "stable".

API/ABI stability
	* For performance reasons, only API compability will be maintained. Expect ABI breakages even between different bugfix releases of the same branch.
	* API compatibility is maintained between different bugfix releases of the same branch (major and minor number) for all non-rc releases.
